# SkratchPlugin
SkratchPlugin is the server-sided plugin responsible for handling packet traffic between Skratch clients and the server. Generally, you shouldn't have to configure anything manually, just add it into your server's plugin directory and install the [Skratch Mod](https://github.com/WallyTube/Skratch).

## Downloads
Skratch is a one-man project, so there are no plans to be supporting older versions of Minecraft or to continue updating older versions of Skratch as Minecraft updates. If you are a fan of the project and want to contribute your own time to make an older build, feel free to contact me.
